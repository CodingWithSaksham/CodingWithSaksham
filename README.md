# Meet Saksham
Hello and welcome! I’m Saksham — a dedicated and driven back-end developer with a strong passion for continuous learning and collaboration. With nearly three years of hands-on experience in Python, I’ve developed a solid foundation in back-end technologies and am committed to deepening my expertise in this domain.

Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new ideas, engaging in conversations about recent technological advancements, and expanding my understanding of both current and historical developments in the tech world. I’m always open to meaningful discussions and collaborations — feel free to reach out!

# 💫 About Me:
